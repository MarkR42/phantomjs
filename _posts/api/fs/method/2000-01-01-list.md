List the contents of a directory on the file system as simple array.
## Examples

```javascript
// EXAMPLE: Show a list of files in a specific directory as a fully qualified path:
var fs = require('fs');
var path = "/etc/";
var list = fs.list(path);
for(var x = 0; x < list.length; x++){
	if(list[x] != "." && list[x] != ".."){
		console.log(path + list[x]);	
	}		
}
```

Note that the entries in the directory seem to be returned in lexical order. Also note that "." and ".." are usually returned, so you may need to add code to ignore them.
